# oliwel 3D Archive

This repo contains files for 3D printing tools and items for my modell 
railroad. The most source files are done with OpenSCAD, anything that 
is listed here was printed with a cheap FDM printer with PLA filament, 
the README in each folder gives some hints on the settings for my 
printer (Anycubic i3 Mega).

All items can be used under the CC BY-NV-SA license unless otherwise
stated.
